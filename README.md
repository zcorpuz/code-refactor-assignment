Homework 1: Code Refactor

For the following project, we are working with a marketing agency, HORISEON. The owner of the company wants the following objective done with the coding:
    "I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
    SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines"

Here is the criteria that he wants met:
    "GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
    WHEN I view the source code
    THEN I find semantic HTML elements
    WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
    THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
    WHEN I view the image elements
    THEN I find accessible alt attributes
    WHEN I view the heading attributes
    THEN they fall in sequential order
    WHEN I view the title element
    THEN I find a concise, descriptive title"

I have gone through the code and refactored it to ensure that we have hit all criteria. I have also made comments before blocks of code to make it more legible on what has changed.
